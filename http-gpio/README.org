* Installation instructions

After installing a Pi OS headless and setting it up for SSH access,
the following commands are necessary:

#+begin_src
sudo apt-get install python3-gpiozero
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install tornado # installs tornado 6.X
#+end_src

* Running the server

A simple

#+begin_src
python3 server.py
#+end_src

from within this directory should suffice.

Then visit =http://localhost:12345= and see how pressing the buttons
affects the color of the rectangles.
